# Living Lands Reloaded

**When the world feels full, but your character feels the same on day 30, survival needs a soul.**

One more ore run turns into a dry sprint home, one bar from collapse.

You don't make it back because you babysat a meter.
You make it back because you played your character.

**Living Lands Reloaded makes those identities matter.**

This mod turns Hytale into an **RPG survival experience** where your needs create stakes, and your professions create a long-term character arc. Journeys require preparation, combat has a cost, and your choices shape who you become.

## 🧭 RPG Survival: Needs That Create Stakes

You get three clear HUD bars on join (simple to read, hard to ignore):

- **Hunger** - Your fuel for the day
- **Thirst** - Your endurance for travel
- **Energy** - Your ability to push hard (sprinting, fighting, extended work)

Baseline drain is paced for normal gameplay, but effort matters:

- Sprinting ramps drain up fast
- Combat increases depletion across the board
- Long swims and harsh travel punish unprepared players

When a stat drops into the danger zone, you don't just "see a number". You feel it in your moment-to-moment play:

- **Starvation** - weakness and damage pressure
- **Dehydration** - movement and stamina pressure
- **Exhaustion** - sprint and combat become desperate

Different foods restore different needs. Your inventory becomes a kit, not a pile.

## 🎭 Choices That Define Your Character

Living Lands isn't about babysitting meters. It's about turning routine play into **role-driven decisions**:

- You're hurt and being chased: sprint now and crash later, or slow down and risk the hit?
- You're mid-build and "almost done": keep placing blocks or break for food before the penalties start?
- You're staring at a distant dungeon: commit with what you packed, or turn back and do it properly?

Survival becomes the pressure. Your build, habits, and profession become the answer.

## 🏅 Professions: Your Character Sheet In Motion

Survival provides the stakes. **Professions provide the fantasy.**

Every action contributes to growth, so progression feels natural instead of grindy:

- Break ore: Mining XP
- Chop trees: Logging XP
- Fight enemies: Combat XP
- Place blocks: Building XP
- Pick up resources: Gathering XP

**Five professions, 100 levels each**, with meaningful passive milestones at **15 / 45 / 100**.

Highlights (examples):

- **Mining** - progression boosts, thirst capacity perks, and bonus ore potential
- **Logging** - energy perks and extra log drops at mastery
- **Combat** - hunger capacity perks and burst mobility after kills
- **Building** - stamina perks and a chance to conserve materials at the top tier
- **Gathering** - pickup bonuses and long-term depletion reduction for true survivors

**Death has consequences:** dying costs **85% XP in 2 random professions**. It turns reckless play into a real gamble, and it makes "we made it back" feel like an accomplishment.
