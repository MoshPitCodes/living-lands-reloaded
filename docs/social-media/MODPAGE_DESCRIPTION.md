**Survival that matters. Progression that reflects how you play.**

Every adventure drains your hunger, thirst, and energy. Sprint home with low energy? You'll move slower. Fight on an empty stomach? Your health suffers. But keep yourself fed and rested, and you'll gain speed and defensive bonuses.

Your playstyle shapes your character. Mine deep? Your thirst capacity grows. Love combat? Your hunger bar extends. The more you do, the better you get at it—with permanent stat boosts and powerful abilities that match your journey.

***

## ⚠️ Compatibility Notice

**NOT COMPATIBLE with:**
- Mods using CustomUI (HUD conflicts)
- MultipleHUD mod
- Mods that manipulate player stats or add XP systems

***

## 🧭 Survival With Consequences & Rewards

Your HUD tracks **Hunger**, **Thirst**, and **Energy**—three needs that change how you play:

- Run low on energy? Move slower. Keep it topped up? Gain speed bonuses.
- Ignore hunger too long? Take damage. Stay well-fed? Boost your max health.
- Skip water breaks? Your stamina suffers. Stay hydrated? Increase your stamina pool.

Everything drains your stats—sprinting burns energy, combat costs hunger, long journeys need water. But you adapt: pack food for expeditions, rest before big fights, and drink before mining deep.

**Works with food mods automatically.** Install any food/drink mod and Living Lands discovers it on startup—no configuration needed.

***

## 🏅 Professions: Become What You Do

Your actions earn XP in five professions: **Combat**, **Mining**, **Logging**, **Building**, and **Gathering**. Fight monsters? Level Combat. Chop trees? Logging grows. Your playstyle naturally shapes your character.

**Abilities unlock as you level:**

- **Level 15:** Learn faster—gain 15% more XP in that profession
- **Level 45:** Gain massive survival boosts—extend your hunger, thirst, or energy pools by 35%
- **Level 100:** Master your craft with powerful abilities:
  - **Combat:** Survive longer (slower metabolism drain) + speed burst on kills
  - **Mining:** Find bonus ores while mining
  - **Logging:** Harvest extra logs from trees
  - **Building:** Get blocks refunded when placing
  - **Gathering:** Restore more hunger/thirst from food pickups

**Death has weight.** You lose XP in your two highest professions when you die, but the system shows mercy—penalties decrease over time and ease up after multiple deaths.

***

## 🛠️ Server Admin Experience

**Zero-friction setup.** Drop in the JAR, start your server, and configs generate automatically. Tweak XP rates, metabolism drain, or death penalties—then hot-reload with `/ll reload` without restarting.

**Flexible configuration.** Set different metabolism rules per world, customize announcements, adjust profession XP rewards. Everything adapts to your server's playstyle.

***

## 📢 Keep Players Informed

Welcome players with custom messages on join, send recurring server tips, or broadcast announcements instantly with `/ll broadcast`. Use placeholders like `{player_name}` and color codes to make messages feel personal.

***

## ⌨️ Commands

**Player:** `/ll stats`, `/ll buffs`, `/ll debuffs`, `/ll professions`, `/ll progress`

**Admin:** `/ll reload`, `/ll broadcast`, `/ll prof`, `/ll scan consumables`

***

## 🛡️ Reliable & Polished

Your progress saves automatically every 5 minutes—no data loss from crashes. Profession bonuses persist when you disconnect. HUD updates instantly when you eat food. The mod runs smoothly in the background while you focus on the adventure.

## 🗺️ What's Next

**Planned:** Land protection, seasonal mechanics, advanced food effects, and more ways to make the world feel alive.

***
