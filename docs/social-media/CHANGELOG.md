# Living Lands Reloaded - Changelog (Mod Upload)

## 1.4.3 (Latest - Auto-Scan Consumables)

### 🎉 NEW: Automatic Consumables Discovery!

Living Lands now **automatically discovers** all consumable items (food, drinks, potions) from installed mods on first startup - no manual configuration needed!

#### Auto-Scan System
- ✅ **Zero-Configuration Setup** - Just install mods and start your server
- ✅ **Automatic Discovery** - Scans Item registry for all consumable items (114 found across 3 mods)
- ✅ **Smart Grouping** - Organizes items by mod namespace for easy management
  - 73 vanilla Hytale items (foods, potions, drinks)
  - 22 NoCube Bakehouse items (breads, pastries)
  - 19 ChampionsVandal More Potions items (stamina/regen/resistance potions)
- ✅ **Fast Performance** - ~200ms scan time for 162 consumable items
- ✅ **Separate Config** - Organized in `metabolism_consumables.yml` (separate from main config)

#### Manual Scan Command
Need to discover new items after installing more mods? Use the manual scan command:

```
/ll scan consumables              # Preview discovered items (no save)
/ll scan consumables --save       # Save to config with namespace grouping
/ll scan consumables --save --section MyMod  # Custom section name
```

**Output Shows:**
- NEW vs ALREADY CONFIGURED items
- Items grouped by mod namespace
- Tier + category for each item

#### How It Works
Living Lands uses Hytale's `AssetMap.getAssetPack()` API to extract the mod namespace from each item:
- `"Hytale:Hytale"` → `"Hytale"`
- `"NoCube:[NoCube's] Bakehouse"` → `"NoCube"`
- `"ChampionsVandal:More Potions"` → `"ChampionsVandal"`

Items are automatically categorized (MEAT, BREAD, POTION, etc.) and assigned tiers (T1-T7) for balanced restoration values.

#### Config Example
```yaml
consumables:
  AutoScan_2026-02-02_Hytale:
    - effectId: Root_Secondary_Consume_Food_T3
      category: FRUIT_VEGGIE
      tier: 3
      itemId: Food_Pie_Apple
    # ... 73 vanilla items
    
  AutoScan_2026-02-02_NoCube:
    - effectId: Root_Secondary_Consume_Food_T1
      category: BREAD
      tier: 1
      itemId: NoCube_Food_Brioche
    # ... 22 bakehouse items
```

### Technical Improvements
- **Effect Detection:** Uses `InteractionType.Secondary` (right-click consumption) instead of `Use`
- **Config Migration:** v5→v6 automatically removes old nested structure
- **Performance:** Optimized scanning with early filtering and efficient namespace extraction

## 1.4.2 (Critical Hotfix)

### 🚨 CRITICAL HOTFIX

**If you downloaded v1.4.0 or v1.4.1, please update to v1.4.2 immediately.**

This release fixes a critical issue where modded consumables implementation files were accidentally omitted from v1.4.0 and v1.4.1.

### What Was Fixed

#### Missing Implementation Files (763 lines of code)
Added 4 core files required for modded consumables feature to work:
- ✅ **ModdedConsumablesConfig.kt** - Configuration data class with 92 pre-configured items
- ✅ **ItemTierDetector.kt** - Automatic tier detection from effect IDs (T1-T7)
- ✅ **ModdedConsumablesRegistry.kt** - O(1) lookup registry for fast item resolution
- ✅ **ModdedItemValidator.kt** - Validation system with caching

#### Impact Without This Hotfix
- ❌ Modded consumables feature completely non-functional
- ❌ Users cloning from GitHub would get compilation errors
- ❌ Feature was announced and documented but implementation was missing

#### What's Included
All features from v1.4.0 and v1.4.1 are included:
- 🎉 Tier 2 Abilities with +35 max stat bonuses
- 🍲 Modded Consumables Support (92 pre-configured items) - **NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- ⚡ Instant food effects (98% faster)

---

## 1.3.1 (Hotfix)

### Performance Optimization
- ⚡ **HUD Refresh Optimization** - 90% faster XP updates! HUD no longer rebuilds entirely when gaining XP
  - Root cause: `notifyXpGain()` was calling both `refreshAllProfessionsPanels()` (efficient) AND `refreshHud()` (full rebuild)
  - Fix: Removed redundant `refreshHud()` call - now only profession panels update
  - Impact: ~100ms → ~10ms per XP gain
  - Entire HUD (metabolism bars, buffs, debuffs) no longer refreshes unnecessarily when gaining XP

---

## 1.3.0

### New Features
- 🎉 **Announcer Module** - Complete server messaging system with:
  - **MOTD (Message of the Day)** - Welcome messages displayed immediately on player join
  - **Welcome Messages** - Different messages for first-time vs returning players with join count tracking
  - **Recurring Announcements** - Automated server tips/info with configurable intervals (5m, 10m, etc.)
  - **Broadcast Commands** - `/ll broadcast <message>` for admins to send server-wide messages
  - **Placeholder Support** - Dynamic values: `{player_name}`, `{server_name}`, `{join_count}`
  - **Color Code Support** - Minecraft-style formatting (`&a` = green, `&6` = gold, etc.)
  - **Hot-Reload** - `/ll reload announcer` updates config without restart
- ✨ **MessageFormatter Enhancement** - New `announcement()` method parses color codes for clean server messages

### Critical Fixes
- 🔥 **HUD Crash on Player Join** - Fixed blocker crash with "Selected element not found: #HungerBar.Text"
  - Root cause: `build()` calling `set()` before client finished parsing UI file
  - Fix: Separated build (structure) from update (data population)
  - Impact: Players can now join without crashes
- 🔥 **Panel Toggle Bug** - Fixed `/ll professions` and `/ll progress` commands showing brief flash then disappearing
  - Root cause: Commands calling `refreshHud()` which rebuilt entire HUD
  - Fix: Removed unnecessary `refreshHud()` calls
  - Impact: Panel commands now work correctly

### Performance
- ⚡ MOTD send: <1ms per player
- ⚡ Welcome message: <5ms per player
- ⚡ Recurring announcements: <10ms broadcast to all players
- 💾 Memory impact: <1MB for join tracking

### Technical Changes
- HUD now uses build/update pattern to prevent race conditions
- Panel toggles populate data directly without full rebuilds
- Announcer uses coroutine-based scheduler with graceful shutdown
- In-memory join tracking with ConcurrentHashMap

---

## 1.2.3 (HOTFIX)

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL: Food Consumption Bug** - Fixed bug where consuming food only restored metabolism stats on the first consumption. Subsequent food consumptions now properly restore hunger/thirst/energy every time.
  - Root cause: Effect detection logic was filtering out re-applied food effects (Hytale reuses effect indexes)
  - Changed detection algorithm to properly handle repeated consumptions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced effect tracking TTL from 5s to 2s for better memory usage
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate player cleanup call on disconnect

### Improved
- **Debugging**: Added logging for re-detected food effects to aid troubleshooting

---

## 1.2.2

### Improved
- **Logging System**: Aligned with Java logging standards (ERROR→SEVERE, TRACE→FINEST, added CONFIG level)

- **Player Disconnect**: Fixed race condition causing "Invalid entity reference" error when players disconnect
- **Log Filtering**: ERROR logs now properly use SEVERE level for production monitoring

### Developer
- **Documentation**: Created FUTURE_MODULES.md preserving design documentation for planned features
- **Build Scripts**: Added cleanup verification script for maintaining code quality

---

## 1.2.1

### Improved
- **Gradle 9.3.1**: Updated build system for better performance
- **Zero Build Warnings**: Fixed all Kotlin compiler warnings for cleaner builds
- **Dynamic Versioning**: Deploy scripts now read version from single source of truth
