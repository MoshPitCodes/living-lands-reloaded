# Living Lands Reloaded - Changelog (Mod Upload)

## 1.4.0 (Latest - Professions Complete!)

### 🎉 Professions Module 100% Complete!

All Tier 3 profession abilities are now fully functional! Reach level 100 to unlock powerful endgame abilities:

#### New Tier 3 Abilities
- **Survivalist (Combat)** - Passive -15% metabolism depletion reduction. Your survival stats drain 15% slower.
- **Adrenaline Rush (Combat)** - Gain +10% speed boost for 5 seconds after killing an entity. Perfect for chasing down fleeing enemies or escaping danger.
- **Ore Sense (Mining)** - 10% chance to get bonus ore drop when mining ore blocks. More resources for your efforts!
- **Timber! (Logging)** - 25% chance to get extra log when chopping trees. Stock up on wood faster!
- **Efficient Architect (Building)** - 12% chance to refund placed block back to inventory. Build more with less!

### Improved
- ⚡ **Admin Command UX** - Instant HUD refresh when using `/ll prof set/add/reset` commands
  - Eliminated ~2 second delay when adjusting profession levels
  - No more metabolism bar flickering during testing
  - Professions panel updates instantly when panel is open
  - Better experience for server owners testing and debugging

### Technical Implementation
- Thread-safe ability triggers with proper cleanup on disconnect/shutdown
- Coroutine-based timed effects for Adrenaline Rush (5 second duration)
- Anti-exploit validation for Efficient Architect (blocks air, liquids, bedrock, command blocks)
- Direct inventory manipulation for item bonuses (Ore Sense, Timber!)
- Ore and log detection helpers for accurate XP tracking

### Performance
- ⚡ Ability triggers: <5ms per activation
- ⚡ HUD refresh: Instant (targeted panel update, not full rebuild)
- 🎯 Zero allocations in hot paths
- 💾 Minimal memory overhead for ability tracking

---

## 1.3.1 (Hotfix)

### Performance Optimization
- ⚡ **HUD Refresh Optimization** - 90% faster XP updates! HUD no longer rebuilds entirely when gaining XP
  - Root cause: `notifyXpGain()` was calling both `refreshAllProfessionsPanels()` (efficient) AND `refreshHud()` (full rebuild)
  - Fix: Removed redundant `refreshHud()` call - now only profession panels update
  - Impact: ~100ms → ~10ms per XP gain
  - Entire HUD (metabolism bars, buffs, debuffs) no longer refreshes unnecessarily when gaining XP

---

## 1.3.0

### New Features
- 🎉 **Announcer Module** - Complete server messaging system with:
  - **MOTD (Message of the Day)** - Welcome messages displayed immediately on player join
  - **Welcome Messages** - Different messages for first-time vs returning players with join count tracking
  - **Recurring Announcements** - Automated server tips/info with configurable intervals (5m, 10m, etc.)
  - **Broadcast Commands** - `/ll broadcast <message>` for admins to send server-wide messages
  - **Placeholder Support** - Dynamic values: `{player_name}`, `{server_name}`, `{join_count}`
  - **Color Code Support** - Minecraft-style formatting (`&a` = green, `&6` = gold, etc.)
  - **Hot-Reload** - `/ll reload announcer` updates config without restart
- ✨ **MessageFormatter Enhancement** - New `announcement()` method parses color codes for clean server messages

### Critical Fixes
- 🔥 **HUD Crash on Player Join** - Fixed blocker crash with "Selected element not found: #HungerBar.Text"
  - Root cause: `build()` calling `set()` before client finished parsing UI file
  - Fix: Separated build (structure) from update (data population)
  - Impact: Players can now join without crashes
- 🔥 **Panel Toggle Bug** - Fixed `/ll professions` and `/ll progress` commands showing brief flash then disappearing
  - Root cause: Commands calling `refreshHud()` which rebuilt entire HUD
  - Fix: Removed unnecessary `refreshHud()` calls
  - Impact: Panel commands now work correctly

### Performance
- ⚡ MOTD send: <1ms per player
- ⚡ Welcome message: <5ms per player
- ⚡ Recurring announcements: <10ms broadcast to all players
- 💾 Memory impact: <1MB for join tracking

### Technical Changes
- HUD now uses build/update pattern to prevent race conditions
- Panel toggles populate data directly without full rebuilds
- Announcer uses coroutine-based scheduler with graceful shutdown
- In-memory join tracking with ConcurrentHashMap

---

## 1.2.3 (HOTFIX)

### Fixed
- 🔥 **CRITICAL: Food Consumption Bug** - Fixed bug where consuming food only restored metabolism stats on the first consumption. Subsequent food consumptions now properly restore hunger/thirst/energy every time.
  - Root cause: Effect detection logic was filtering out re-applied food effects (Hytale reuses effect indexes)
  - Changed detection algorithm to properly handle repeated consumptions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced effect tracking TTL from 5s to 2s for better memory usage
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate player cleanup call on disconnect

### Improved
- **Debugging**: Added logging for re-detected food effects to aid troubleshooting

---

## 1.2.2

### Improved
- **Logging System**: Aligned with Java logging standards (ERROR→SEVERE, TRACE→FINEST, added CONFIG level)
- **Cleaner Logs**: Changed 215 INFO logs to FINE for reduced default verbosity
- **Codebase Quality**: Removed 770 lines of stub code and 87 TODO comments
- **Code Organization**: Added safety guards to prevent accidental enablement of incomplete modules

### Fixed
- **Player Disconnect**: Fixed race condition causing "Invalid entity reference" error when players disconnect
- **Log Filtering**: ERROR logs now properly use SEVERE level for production monitoring

### Developer
- **Documentation**: Created FUTURE_MODULES.md preserving design documentation for planned features
- **Build Scripts**: Added cleanup verification script for maintaining code quality

---

## 1.2.1

### Improved
- **Gradle 9.3.1**: Updated build system for better performance
- **Zero Build Warnings**: Fixed all Kotlin compiler warnings for cleaner builds
- **Dynamic Versioning**: Deploy scripts now read version from single source of truth

---

  - **Iron Stomach** (Combat L45): +15 max hunger capacity
  - **Desert Nomad** (Mining L45): +10 max thirst capacity
  - **Tireless Woodsman** (Logging L45): +10 max energy capacity
  - **Hearty Gatherer** (Gathering L45): +4 hunger and thirst when picking up food items
- **Unified HUD System**: Cleaner, more performant single-element HUD

### Improved
- **Ability Effect Tracking**: New centralized system ensures abilities apply correctly on login, level up, and world changes
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed ~1,200 lines of legacy HUD code for better maintainability

### Fixed

- **HUD Crash**: Fixed crash caused by incorrect UI path resolution
